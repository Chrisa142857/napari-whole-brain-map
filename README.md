## [Napari](https://napari.org/stable/) plugin for whole-brain representation, e.g., Density map, volume map, ...

This is based on the results of instance segmentation pipeline in this [repo](https://github.com/chrisa142857/Lightsheet_microscopy_image_3D_nuclei_instance_segmentation).

## TODO list

 - [x] Load segmentation results
 - [x] Generate representation map of each individual stack
 - [ ] Apply automatic stitching program
 - [x] Apply Imaris stitcher results
 - [x] Undouble segmentations within stitching seams to fuse all stacks as the whole-brain map
 - [ ] Documenting
